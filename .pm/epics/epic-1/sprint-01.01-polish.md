# Sprint 01.01-Polish: Day Schedule UI Polish

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-30  
**End Date**: 2024-12-30  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - App Shell & Beautiful UI

**Sprint Goal**: To elevate the `DaySchedule` component from a functional wireframe into a visually stunning, polished, and "delightful" user experience by refining animations, visual hierarchy, and micro-interactions.

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

- **Follow existing patterns**: Use `cn()` for classes, custom Tailwind theme variables, etc.
- **Performance in mind**: Ensure animations are smooth and don't degrade performance.
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors.

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1.  Implement a skeleton loader for a professional perceived loading experience.
2.  Add fluid, cascading animations for time blocks to create a "fade-in, slide-up" effect.
3.  Refine visual polish by adding depth, improving typography, and creating a more elegant time indicator.
4.  Enhance micro-interactions for task completion and hover states to make the UI feel more tactile and responsive.

### Files to Modify
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/DaySchedule.tsx` | Add skeleton loader, apply staggered animations to blocks. | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/globals.css` | Define new keyframe animations (`fade-in-slide-up`, `pulse`). | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TimeBlock.tsx` | Refine styles, add "lift" on hover, improve typography. | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/CurrentTimeIndicator.tsx` | Update styles for a thinner, pulsing indicator. | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TaskItem.tsx` | Add smooth transitions for task completion state change. | COMPLETED |

### Implementation Approach
1.  **Skeleton Loader**: Create a `DayScheduleSkeleton` component within `DaySchedule.tsx`. Use the existing `Skeleton` component from `@/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` to mimic the final layout.
2.  **Animations**: In `globals.css`, define `@keyframes fade-in-slide-up` and `@keyframes pulse`. In `DaySchedule.tsx`, apply the animation to time blocks with a calculated `animation-delay` to create a cascading effect.
3.  **Visual Polish**:
    - In `TimeBlock.tsx`, adjust styles to use softer, transparent borders (`border-border/50`) and a subtle `box-shadow` that intensifies on hover. Add a `transform` to "lift" the block on hover.
    - In `CurrentTimeIndicator.tsx`, make the line thinner (`0.5px`) and apply the `pulse` animation to the dot.
4.  **Micro-interactions**: In `TaskItem.tsx`, add `transition-all` and `duration-150` classes to the text element to animate the color and line-through property changes smoothly.

### Key Code Additions
```css
/* In globals.css */
@keyframes fade-in-slide-up {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(10px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes pulse {
  50% {
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
}
```

```typescript
// In DaySchedule.tsx
// A new <DayScheduleSkeleton /> component will be created.

// On each time block, style will be added:
// style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 50}ms` }}
```

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [x] Skeleton loader appears correctly before the schedule is ready.
- [x] Time blocks animate in with a smooth, staggered effect.
- [x] Hovering on a time block "lifts" it with an increased shadow.
- [x] Current time indicator line is thin and the dot pulses gently.
- [x] Checking a task results in a smooth line-through animation.
- [x] All previous functionality remains intact.
