# Sprint 01.00: Infrastructure & Core Setup Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: HANDOFF  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-30  
**End Date**: 2024-12-30  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - App Shell & Beautiful UI

**Sprint Goal**: Set up the foundational infrastructure for dayli - routes, state management, and two-column layout structure.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Enables the single-screen focus interface foundation for Story 1: Morning Planning
- Sets up the layout structure for Story 5: AI Assistant Control

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use existing UI components**: From `@/components/ui` and `@repo/ui`
- **Follow Tailwind patterns**: Use consistent spacing and color tokens
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale (space-4, gap-2, etc.)
- **Colors**: Use CSS variables from globals.css

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Set up `/focus` route as the main application screen (protected via middleware)
2. Configure Zustand stores for schedule, email, and chat state
3. Create two-column layout with collapsible chat panel (no sidebar)
4. Implement mock data generation system
5. Update root page to handle auth flow (/ â†’ /login â†’ /focus)
6. Create floating user menu with avatar

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `apps/web/app/page.tsx` | Simplify to handle auth redirects | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` | Ensure it works with new focus layout | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/package.json` | Add zustand and date-fns dependencies | COMPLETED |

### Files to Remove
| File Path | Reason | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `apps/web/app/(chat)/*` | Not aligned with radical focus philosophy | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/app/dashboard/*` | Not needed for focus-only app | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/app/page.module.css` | Unused styles | COMPLETED |
| `apps/web/components/dashboard/*` | Dashboard-specific components | COMPLETED |

### Implementation Approach
1. **Dependencies First**: Install zustand and date-fns
2. **Middleware Setup**: Create middleware for route protection
3. **Module Structure**: Create modules directory and subdirectories
4. **Type Definitions**: Create all TypeScript interfaces for data models
5. **Store Setup**: Implement Zustand stores with initial state
6. **Mock Data System**: Build generator for realistic daily schedules
7. **User Menu**: Create floating avatar with dropdown
8. **Layout Structure**: Create two-column layout without sidebar
9. **Route Implementation**: Set up /focus with middleware protection
10. **Cleanup**: Remove unused routes and components
11. **Integration**: Connect stores to layout and test data flow

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **No Sidebar**: Clean, focused interface with floating user menu
- **Middleware Protection**: Use Next.js middleware for route guards
- **Module-based organization**: Each feature (schedule, email, chat) has its own module
- **Calming Design**: Keep off-white beige background (#FAF9F5)
- **Auth Flow**: / â†’ /login â†’ /focus with middleware handling

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- zustand: ^5.0.2 - State management
- date-fns: ^3.0.0 - Date/time utilities
- Existing auth system - Will reuse for route protection

**Identified Risks**:
- **Middleware complexity**: First time using Next.js middleware - Mitigation: Follow Next.js docs carefully
- **Module restructuring**: Moving from flat to module structure - Mitigation: Create clear imports/exports

## Implementation Log

### Day-by-Day Progress
**2024-12-30**:
- Started: Sprint planning and investigation
