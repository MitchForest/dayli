# Sprint 01.02: Tasks & Email Decisions Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-30  
**End Date**: [TBD]  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - App Shell & Beautiful UI

**Sprint Goal**: Implement task display within time blocks and create the email decision interface, bringing interactivity to the schedule with mock data.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Completes Story 1: Morning Planning - Interactive tasks within time blocks
- Delivers Story 4: Quick Decisions - Email decision card UI with Now/Tomorrow/Never actions

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use existing UI components**: From `@/components/ui` and `@repo/ui`
- **Follow Tailwind patterns**: Use consistent spacing and color tokens
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale (space-4, gap-2, etc.)
- **Colors**: Use CSS variables from globals.css

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Create TaskItem component with checkbox and completion animations âœ“ (Already exists - enhance it)
2. Integrate tasks into Focus blocks (3-7 tasks total per day) âœ“ (Already integrated - enhance animations)
3. Build email decision card interface with swipe-like interactions
4. Implement email queue display within Email blocks
5. Add daily stats display showing progress
6. Connect all interactions to Zustand stores

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TaskItem.tsx` | Individual task with checkbox | ENHANCED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TaskList.tsx` | Task container within blocks | NOT NEEDED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/DailyStats.tsx` | Stats bar at top of schedule | COMPLETED âœ“ |

| `apps/web/modules/schedule/hooks/useTaskActions.ts` | Task completion logic | COMPLETED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/email/hooks/useEmailActions.ts` | Email decision logic | COMPLETED âœ“ |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/FocusBlock.tsx` | Add TaskList component | NOT NEEDED - Already integrated |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/EmailBlock.tsx` | Add EmailQueue component | COMPLETED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/DaySchedule.tsx` | Add DailyStats at top | COMPLETED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/store/scheduleStore.ts` | Add task actions | PARTIAL - Enhance existing |
| `apps/web/modules/email/store/emailStore.ts` | Add email actions | ENHANCED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TaskItem.tsx` | Add animations and source icons | COMPLETED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/QuickDecisionsBlock.tsx` | Use EmailQueue with compact mode | COMPLETED âœ“ |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/utils/mockGenerator.ts` | Add source variety to tasks | COMPLETED âœ“ |

### Implementation Approach
1. **Task Components**: Enhance TaskItem with smooth checkbox animations and source icons
2. **Task Integration**: Already integrated - focus on animations and interactivity
3. **Email Cards**: Create swipeable-feel decision cards with directional animations
4. **Decision Flow**: Implement Now/Tomorrow/Never with visual feedback
5. **Stats Display**: Minimal progress indicators at top of schedule
6. **Store Actions**: Connect all interactions to update state with optimistic updates

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Checkbox animations**: CSS transitions with scale(0.8) to scale(1) on check
- **Card stack design**: Emails stack with 4px vertical offset and slight scale for depth
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate UI feedback before store updates
- **Limited tasks**: Enforce 3-7 task limit in mock data (already enforced)
- **Email animations**: Slide left for "Never", right for "Now", fade for "Tomorrow"
- **Source icons**: Mail for email source, Calendar for calendar, Sparkles for AI
- **Quick Decisions vs Email blocks**: Same components but more compact in Quick Decisions

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Sprint 01.00 & 01.01 completion âœ“
- lucide-react for icons âœ“ (Already installed)
- Existing UI components âœ“

**Identified Risks**:
- **Animation performance**: Multiple simultaneous animations - Mitigation: Use CSS transforms, not layout changes
- **State complexity**: Task/email state updates - Mitigation: Clear action patterns in stores
- **Visual hierarchy**: Tasks within blocks - Mitigation: Careful spacing and typography

### Files Modified/Created
**Created**:
- `apps/web/modules/email/components/EmailDecisionCard.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/email/components/DecisionButtons.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/email/components/EmailQueue.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/email/components/EmailCounter.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/email/components/index.ts`
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/DailyStats.tsx`
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/hooks/useTaskActions.ts`
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/hooks/index.ts`
- `apps/web/modules/email/hooks/useEmailActions.ts`
- `apps/web/modules/email/hooks/index.ts`

**Modified**:
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/TaskItem.tsx` - Added animations and source icons
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/EmailBlock.tsx` - Integrated EmailQueue
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/QuickDecisionsBlock.tsx` - Integrated EmailQueue with compact mode
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/components/DaySchedule.tsx` - Added DailyStats at top
- `apps/web/modules/email/store/emailStore.ts` - Enhanced processEmail with stats updates
- `apps/web/modules/schedule/utils/mockGenerator.ts` - Added source variety to tasks

### Key Decisions Made
- Used CSS transforms for all animations to ensure smooth performance
- Implemented directional animations for email decisions (left/right/fade)
- Created stacked card effect using absolute positioning and scale transforms
- Added hover states throughout for better interactivity
- Used semantic color tokens (success, warning, destructive) for decision buttons
- Made Quick Decisions use compact mode for better space efficiency

### Deviations from Original Plan
- No TaskList component needed - FocusBlock already handles task integration perfectly
- Enhanced existing TaskItem rather than recreating it
- Added index files for cleaner imports (not in original plan but improves code organization)

### Known Issues/Concerns
- Email decision animations are one-way (no undo functionality yet)
- Stats update immediately on action (no debouncing)
- Mock data regenerates on page refresh (expected for this sprint)

### Suggested Review Focus
- Animation performance with multiple simultaneous animations
- Interaction responsiveness on rapid clicks
- Visual hierarchy within time blocks
- State update patterns and potential race conditions
- Accessibility of interactive elements

**Sprint Status**: HANDOFF

## Learnings for Future Sprints

- Investigating existing code thoroughly saves time - discovered TaskItem already existed

- Index files should be part of standard module creation
- CSS transforms are key for smooth animations
- Zustand's getState() is useful for cross-store updates
