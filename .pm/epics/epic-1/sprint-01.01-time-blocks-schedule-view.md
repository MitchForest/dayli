# Sprint 01.01: Time Blocks & Schedule View Tracker

## Sprint Overview

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: 2024-12-30  
**End Date**: [TBD]  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - App Shell & Beautiful UI

**Sprint Goal**: Build the complete day schedule view with all time block types, creating a beautiful time-based interface from 8 AM to 6 PM.

**User Story Contribution**: 
- Delivers visual schedule for Story 1: Morning Planning - Shows 3-7 tasks in time blocks
- Implements time block visualization for Story 3: Protected Focus Time

## ðŸš¨ Required Development Practices

### Database Management
- **Use Supabase MCP** to inspect current database state: `mcp_supabase_get_schemas`, `mcp_supabase_get_tables`, etc.
- **Keep types synchronized**: Run type generation after ANY schema changes
- **Migration files required**: Every database change needs a migration file
- **Test migrations**: Ensure migrations run cleanly on fresh database

### UI/UX Consistency
- **Use existing UI components**: From `@/components/ui` and `@repo/ui`
- **Follow Tailwind patterns**: Use consistent spacing and color tokens
- **Standard spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale (space-4, gap-2, etc.)
- **Colors**: Use CSS variables from globals.css

### Code Quality
- **Zero tolerance**: No lint errors, no TypeScript errors
- **Type safety**: No `any` types without explicit justification
- **Run before handoff**: `bun run lint && bun run typecheck`

## Sprint Plan

### Objectives
1. Create DaySchedule component with CSS Grid time layout (8 AM - 6 PM)
2. Implement all 5 time block types with distinct visual styles
3. Add current time indicator that updates
4. Build time grid system with 15-minute increments
5. Connect to mock data from scheduleStore

### Files to Create
| File Path | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|

| `apps/web/modules/schedule/hooks/useSchedule.ts` | Main schedule hook | NOT STARTED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/hooks/useCurrentTime.ts` | Current time tracker | NOT STARTED |

### Files to Modify  
| File Path | Changes Needed | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `apps/web/app/focus/page.tsx` | Add DaySchedule component | NOT STARTED |
| `apps/web/lib/constants.ts` | Add time block colors and gradients | NOT STARTED |
| `apps/web/modules/schedule/store/scheduleStore.ts` | Connect to components | NOT STARTED |

### Implementation Approach
1. **Time Grid Foundation**: Create CSS Grid with 40 rows (10 hours Ã— 4 quarters)
2. **Base Components**: Build TimeBlock base and TimeLabel components
3. **Block Variants**: Implement each block type with unique styling
4. **Current Time**: Add indicator with auto-update every minute
5. **Integration**: Connect to scheduleStore and mock data
6. **Polish**: Add hover states, transitions, and visual refinements

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **CSS Grid over absolute positioning**: Cleaner, handles overlaps better
- **15-minute increments**: Each row = 15 minutes, blocks span multiple rows
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Subtle gradients for focus blocks to feel premium
- **Component composition**: Base TimeBlock with variant components

### Dependencies & Risks
**Dependencies**:
- Sprint 01.00 completion (stores and types) âœ…
- Tailwind CSS for styling âœ…
- date-fns for time calculations âœ…

**Identified Risks**:
- **Performance with frequent updates**: Current time indicator - Mitigation: Use React.memo and careful re-render control
- **Time zone handling**: Different user time zones - Mitigation: Use system time zone for MVP
- **Overlapping blocks**: Calendar conflicts - Mitigation: Show primary block with conflict indicator

## Implementation Log

### Day-by-Day Progress
**2024-12-30**:
- Started: Sprint planning and codebase investigation
- Completed: Comprehensive implementation plan
- Blockers: Minor TypeScript error in auth package (not blocking)
- Decisions: 
  - Use subtle vertical gradients for focus blocks
  - Create TaskItem component for task display
  - Handle overlaps with z-index and 10px horizontal offset
  - Leave empty time slots without visual indication
  - Implement hover states only (no click interactions yet)

### Reality Checks & Plan Updates

**Reality Check 1** - 2024-12-30
- Issue: Several implementation details were unclear in original sprint doc
- Options Considered:
  1. Wait for clarification vs. Make reasonable decisions
  2. Simple task display vs. Full TaskItem component
- Decision: Proceed with suggested approaches to maintain momentum
- Plan Update: Added TaskItem component to files to create
- Epic Impact: None - stays within sprint scope

- Local state for current time updates

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Full day schedule renders (8 AM - 6 PM)
- [ ] All 5 block types display correctly
- [ ] Current time indicator moves
- [ ] Time labels show correctly
- [ ] Blocks align to 15-minute grid
- [ ] Different mock scenarios work
- [ ] Window resize maintains layout

### Edge Cases Considered
- Empty time slots
- Overlapping meetings
- Blocks at day boundaries (before 8 AM, after 6 PM)
- Current time outside schedule hours
- Very short blocks (15 minutes)
- Very long blocks (4+ hours)

## Documentation Updates
