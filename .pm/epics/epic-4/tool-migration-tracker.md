## Summary

✅ **Migration Complete!** All 36 tools have been successfully migrated to the "dumb executor" pattern.

### Key Changes Made:
1. Removed ALL natural language parsing from tools
2. Deleted `time-parser.ts` entirely
3. Changed all Date objects in responses to ISO strings
4. Removed auto-scheduling logic that used `new Date()`
5. Tools now only accept concrete values:
   - Dates: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Times: "HH:MM"
   - IDs: Direct string IDs
   - Statuses: Enum values only

### Architecture Achievement:
- **Before**: Tools parsed "tomorrow", "2pm", "the 9am block"
- **After**: Tools only accept "2024-07-05", "14:00", "block_123"
- **AI Orchestrator**: Resolves ALL natural language to concrete values
- **Zero TypeScript errors**: Both lint and typecheck pass
