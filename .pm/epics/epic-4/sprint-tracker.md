# Sprint Tracker: Smart AI Natural Language System

## Sprint Overview
- **Start Date**: December 18, 2024
- **Duration**: 3-5 days
- **Goal**: Implement AI-powered natural language understanding for all user interactions

## Day 1 (December 18, 2024)

### Morning Session ✅
**Phase 1: Core AI Infrastructure**
- [x] Created CompleteContext interface (`apps/web/modules/ai/types/complete-context.ts`)
- [x] Created CompleteUnderstanding schema (`apps/web/modules/ai/types/complete-understanding.ts`)
- [x] Built AIOrchestrator service (`apps/web/modules/ai/services/ai-orchestrator.ts`)
- [x] Created comprehensive prompt builder (`apps/web/modules/ai/services/prompt-builder.ts`)
- [x] Fixed all TypeScript errors

### Afternoon Session ✅
**Phase 1.5: Consolidation & Cleanup**
- [x] Merged orchestration.service.ts → ai-orchestrator.ts
- [x] Merged context-builder.ts → ai-orchestrator.ts
- [x] Stripped chat route from 728 to ~110 lines
- [x] Deleted 4 old files
- [x] All tests pass (lint & typecheck)

### Evening Session ✅
**Phase 1 Completion: Execution Engine**
- [x] Created ExecutionEngine (`apps/web/modules/ai/services/execution-engine.ts`)
  - Executes tools with resolved parameters
  - Tracks operations for reference resolution
  - Handles single, workflow, and multi-step executions
  - Maintains operation history for "it/that" resolution
- [x] Integrated ExecutionEngine with AIOrchestrator
  - Non-streaming tools use ExecutionEngine
  - Streaming workflows still use existing pattern
  - Context updated with operation results
- [x] Fixed all TypeScript errors
- [x] All tests pass (lint & typecheck)

### Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅

## Day 2 (December 19, 2024)

### Morning Session
**Phase 2: Prompt Engineering**
- [ ] Test comprehensive prompts with real examples
- [ ] Fine-tune resolution rules
- [ ] Add edge case handling
- [ ] Validate with complex scenarios

### Afternoon Session  
**Phase 3: Tool Migration**
- [ ] Update all 25+ tools to remove NLP logic
- [ ] Tools should only validate and execute
- [ ] All resolution happens in AIOrchestrator

## Day 3 (December 20, 2024)

### Morning Session
**Phase 4: Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test all user flows end-to-end
- [ ] Verify date/time resolution
- [ ] Test entity reference resolution
- [ ] Validate workflow persistence

### Afternoon Session
**Phase 5: Polish & Deploy**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] User feedback messages
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Progress Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,000 new, ~1,500 deleted
- **Files Created**: 5
- **Files Deleted**: 4
- **TypeScript Errors Fixed**: 26
- **Test Coverage**: TBD

## Key Achievements
1. ✅ Consolidated all AI logic into single orchestrator
2. ✅ Created comprehensive type system for context and understanding
3. ✅ Built execution engine with operation tracking
4. ✅ Reduced chat route complexity by 85%
5. ✅ Zero TypeScript errors

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Prompt Engineering
- Test with real user scenarios
- Prepare for tool migration
