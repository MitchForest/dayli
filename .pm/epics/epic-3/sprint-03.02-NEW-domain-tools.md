# Sprint 03.02 NEW: Domain Tools & Operations

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Number**: 03.02  
**Epic**: Epic 3 - AI-First Chat & Intelligent Workflows  
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### Sprint Goal
Build stateless, single-purpose domain tools that form the foundation for all intelligent workflows. These tools are the building blocks that workflows will orchestrate to create complex behaviors.

### Key Principles
- **Stateless**: Each tool performs one operation without maintaining state
- **Composable**: Tools can be combined by workflows in any order
- **Domain-Focused**: Organized by domain (email, task, schedule, calendar)
- **Workflow-Agnostic**: Tools don't know about workflows that use them

## Critical Integration Points Not to Miss

1. **Email Integration**:
   - Gmail service needs methods for backlog operations
   - Existing tools need urgency/importance fields added
   - Real-time email updates need to trigger analysis

2. **Task Integration**:
   - Task service needs scoring/pattern methods
   - Backlog view needs to be created and used
   - Task creation should auto-score

3. **Schedule Integration**:
   - Schedule service needs gap/efficiency analysis
   - Real-time schedule updates need to trigger reanalysis
   - Calendar protection needs Google Calendar API (marked TODO)

4. **Cross-Domain Integration**:
   - Email → Task conversion flow
   - Task → Schedule assignment flow
   - Calendar → Schedule sync flow
