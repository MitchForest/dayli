- **Resolution**: AI-powered suggestions with feasibility scoring
- **Optimization**: Multi-attendee scheduling, meeting consolidation
- **Analytics**: Pattern detection, meeting load analysis

### 5. Schedule Operations (8 new tools)
- **Analysis**: Gap detection, inefficiency metrics, focus time calculation
- **Optimization**: Load balancing, time consolidation, break protection
- **Transitions**: Context switch minimization, buffer management
- **Search**: Find optimal time slots for specific activities

### 6. Helper Utilities (4 utilities)
- **Time Parser**: Flexible natural language time parsing
- **Workflow Persistence**: State management with TTL and cleanup
- **Proposal Store**: Confirmation flow for user actions
- **Error Recovery**: Retry logic, error categorization, partial success

### 7. Database Integration (3 migrations)
- **workflow_states**: Persistent storage for interrupted workflows
- **email_backlog**: Enhanced with indexes and calculated fields
- **task_backlog_view**: Unified view with summary functions

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
