**Statuses**: NOT STARTED | IN PROGRESS | IN REVIEW | APPROVED | BLOCKED

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### High-Level Architecture for This Epic
- Service interface pattern for easy mock → real API migration
- LangGraph.js for complex AI workflow orchestration
- pgvector for RAG implementation with embeddings
- Resizable panels for flexible UI layout
- Zustand stores for state management

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Service Interface Pattern**: Mock services implement same interface as future real services
   - Alternatives considered: Separate mock API endpoints
   - Rationale: No duplicate work when switching to real APIs
   - Trade-offs: Slightly more complex initial setup

2. **Canvas System Removal**: Replaced complex canvas with simple scroll-based view
   - Alternatives considered: Fix canvas bugs, keep architecture
   - Rationale: Canvas was over-engineered for our needs
   - Trade-offs: Lost infinite scroll (not needed for MVP)

3. **Chat on Right Side**: Changed from left to right panel placement
   - Alternatives considered: Keep chat on left as designed
   - Rationale: Better UX flow - schedule primary, chat secondary
   - Trade-offs: None significant

### Dependencies
**External Dependencies**:
- `@langchain/langgraph`: ^0.2.0 - AI workflow orchestration
- `react-resizable-panels`: ^2.0.0 - Panel layout
- `ai`: ^3.0.0 - Vercel AI SDK for chat
- `framer-motion`: ^11.0.0 - Smooth animations

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Requires: Database schema from Epic 1
- Provides: UI foundation for Epic 3 (real integrations)

### API Endpoints Added
| Method | Path | Purpose | Sprint |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| GET | /api/gmail/messages | Fetch mock emails | 02.01 |
| GET | /api/calendar/events | Fetch mock calendar | 02.01 |
| POST | /api/workflows/daily-planning | Generate schedule | 02.03 |
| POST | /api/workflows/email-triage | Process emails | 02.03 |

### Data Model Changes
- Added mock data generation scripts
- Created service interfaces for Gmail/Calendar APIs
- Implemented TypeScript types for all entities

### Key Functions/Components Created
- `ChatPanel` - Resizable chat interface - Sprint 02.02
- `ScheduleView` - Refactored schedule display - Sprint 02.02
- `createDailyPlanningWorkflow` - LangGraph workflow - Sprint 02.03
- `EmailTriageBlock` - Email decision UI - Sprint 02.03

## Sprint Execution Log

### Sprint 02.01: Foundation & Data Layer
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Summary**: Created comprehensive mock data services with 100+ emails, 30+ tasks, 7 days of events
**Key Decisions**: Service interface pattern for clean migration path
**Issues Encountered**: None - clean implementation

### Sprint 02.02: UI Components & Layout
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Summary**: Major refactoring - removed canvas system, implemented clean panel layout
**Key Decisions**: 
- Remove over-engineered canvas (~500 lines)
- Use native browser scroll
- Framer Motion for animations
**Issues Encountered**: Canvas system causing overlap/gesture issues - solved by removal

### Sprint 02.03: Core Functionality & Workflows
**Status**: APPROVED  
**Summary**: Successfully implemented LangGraph workflows for planning and email triage
**Key Decisions**: 
- Used service interface pattern for Supabase integration
- Simplified MVP by using mock patterns instead of complex RAG
- Implemented basic daily planning and email triage workflows
**Issues Encountered**: 
- Type safety issues with LangGraph edges (used `as any` workaround)
- "Plan Your Day" button approach too rigid - needs AI-first redesign
- Runtime errors in workflow execution need debugging

## Testing & Quality

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing of all UI interactions
- Mock data covers edge cases
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Known Issues
| Issue | Severity | Sprint | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Canvas overlap | HIGH | 02.02 | FIXED | Removed canvas system |
| TypeScript errors in database package | LOW | 02.03 | OPEN | Sprint 3 WIP, not affecting Sprint 2 |

## Refactoring Completed

### Code Improvements
- **Canvas System Removal**: Deleted 500+ lines of complex code, replaced with 100 lines
- **Simple Schedule Store**: 49 lines vs 247 lines in old CanvasStore

### Performance Optimizations
- **Removed 60fps render loop**: No more unnecessary updates
- **Native scrolling**: Better performance than custom camera

## Learnings & Gotchas

### What Worked Well
- **Service Interface Pattern**: Clean architecture for mock → real migration
- **Pragmatic Refactoring**: Identifying and fixing root causes
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations with simple API

### Challenges Faced
- **Canvas Complexity**: Over-engineered solution causing bugs
- **Panel Overlap**: Z-index issues with original implementation

### Gotchas for Future Development
- **Keep It Simple**: Don't over-engineer - browser native features often suffice
- **Test Panel Resize**: Always verify behavior at different panel sizes
