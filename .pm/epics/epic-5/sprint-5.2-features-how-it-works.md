# Sprint 5.2: Features & How It Works

**Duration**: 2 days  
**Goal**: Showcase core features and explain the product elegantly through interactive components and smooth animations.

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on communicating dayli's value through a carefully crafted features section and an interactive "How It Works" timeline. We'll use visual storytelling to show how dayli transforms a chaotic workday into focused productivity.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Features section with 6 core benefit cards
- [ ] Smooth scroll reveal animations
- [ ] "How It Works" interactive timeline
- [ ] Day preview components for each step
- [ ] Click-to-explore timeline interaction
- [ ] Animated transitions between steps
- [ ] Responsive grid layouts
- [ ] Consistent icon usage from Lucide
- [ ] Performance optimized animations

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Features Section Structure

#### Layout
- 3-column grid on desktop
- 2-column on tablet  
- Single column on mobile
- Cards with hover lift effect
- Consistent spacing using design system

#### Feature Cards
Each card includes:
- Lucide icon with semantic color
- Bold headline
- Descriptive text
- Subtle border and shadow
- Hover state with transform

#### The 6 Core Features

1. **AI Executive Assistant** (Brain icon, primary color)
   - "Makes every decision about what you should work on, analyzing context and patterns."

2. **Time-Based Scheduling** (Clock icon, orange)
   - "Everything exists in time blocks. No floating tasks, just a clear daily timeline."

3. **Email Triage** (Mail icon, blue)
   - "2D analysis of importance × urgency. 80% of emails handled without you seeing them."

4. **Protected Focus Time** (Calendar icon, purple)
   - "Deep work blocks are sacred. Meetings auto-declined during focus time."

5. **Enforced Constraints** (Shield icon, green)
   - "3-7 tasks max per day. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow doesn't exist."

6. **Natural Language Control** (Zap icon, yellow)
   - "No buttons, no menus. Just tell the AI what you need in plain English."

### 2. How It Works Section

#### Interactive Timeline Design
- Left side: Clickable timeline steps
- Right side: Animated preview panel
- Active step highlighted with primary color
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Progress indicator on timeline

#### The 4 Steps

**Step 1: Open dayli (8:45 AM)**
- Preview: Empty schedule view
- Message: "Your day is already planned. No decisions needed."

**Step 2: Say 'Plan my day' (8:46 AM)**
- Preview: AI chat interaction
- Message: "AI analyzes calendar, emails, and tasks to create optimal schedule."

**Step 3: Start Deep Work (9:00 AM)**
- Preview: Full schedule with current time indicator
- Message: "Focus time protected. Distractions blocked. Just execute."

**Step 4: Day Complete (4:00 PM)**
- Preview: Completed tasks with stats
- Message: "5 of 6 tasks done. Tomorrow planned. Sign off with clarity."

### 3. Animation Strategy

```typescript
// Scroll-triggered animations
const scrollVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
  visible: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    y: 0,
    transition: { 
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  }
};

// Timeline step transitions
const stepVariants = {
  inactive: { opacity: 0.6, scale: 0.95 },
  active: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    scale: 1,
    transition: { 
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 30
    }
  }
};
```

### 4. Component Architecture

```

│   ├── Features.tsx
│   ├── FeatureCard.tsx
│   └── featureData.ts
└── HowItWorks/
    ├── HowItWorks.tsx

    ├── DayPreview.tsx
    └── previewVariants.ts
```

## Implementation Details

### Scroll Animations

Using Framer Motion's `whileInView`:
- Trigger once for performance
- 20% threshold for early trigger
- Stagger children for cascade effect
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Preview Components

Each step has a unique preview:
1. **Empty State**: Minimal grid with time labels
2. **AI Planning**: Chat bubbles with typing animation
3. **Active Work**: Full schedule with animated blocks
4. **Completion**: Checked tasks with celebration animation

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy load preview components
- Use CSS transforms only
- Debounce scroll events
- Minimize re-renders with memo
- Optimize image assets

## Visual Design

### Features Section
- Background: Subtle muted/30 for contrast
- Cards: White/dark with border
- Icons: 40px with semantic colors
- Spacing: Consistent 8px grid
- Typography: Clear hierarchy

### How It Works
- Timeline: Vertical line with dots
- Active indicator: Primary color
- Preview panel: Elevated card style
- Transitions: Smooth 300ms
- Mobile: Accordion-style layout

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] All animations perform at 60fps
- [ ] Timeline interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Responsive layouts correct
- [ ] Touch interactions on mobile
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for timeline
- [ ] Screen reader announces steps
- [ ] No layout shifts during animations
- [ ] Images optimized and lazy loaded
- [ ] Cross-browser animation support

## Content Guidelines

### Features Copy
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Keep descriptions under 20 words
- Use active voice
- Avoid technical jargon
- Focus on outcomes

### Timeline Copy
- Use specific times for realism
- Show progression through day
- Highlight key moments
- Keep messages conversational
- End with success metric

## Next Steps

After completing features and timeline:
1. User test the timeline interaction
2. Optimize animation performance
3. A/B test feature order
4. Begin Sprint 5.3 (Social proof)
